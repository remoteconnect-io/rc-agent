## Building Application ##

### Install dependencies

```>$ go mod tidy```

### Build

```>$ go build .```

Passing in environment vars from the commandline:

```>$ PROV_HEARTBEAT="6" ./prov-agent```

Need something here about creating the keys

Need something here about the config file requirements

Not sure what the known_hosts file is all about, probably need something on that
